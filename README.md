## Data Analytics assignment to predict if fictitious cryptocurrency stock data are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes
### Overview
1. Prepare the data
2. Determine a suitable number of clusters for the data
3. Cluster the data
### Features
1. Use `StandardScaler()` from `scikit-learn` to normalize the provided data
2. Use the elbow method to find the best value for `k`
3. Use K-means with `k` to cluster the data
4. Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the scaled data and repeat the process above
### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with and use of the Python programming language, and software to interact with .ipynb files, such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
### Usage
- Download the contents of the repo (as they are) to the same directory
- Launch Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the appropriate directory, and open Crypto_Clustering.ipynb
- If desired, clear outputs and inspect/run the code cell by cell, paying attention to prompts and comments throughout
- Have fun exploring/playing around with the data/code! What are some ways the code could be made more clear or efficient?
